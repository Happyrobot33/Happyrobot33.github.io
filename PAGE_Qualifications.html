                            My engineering experience has been developed through a combination of mentorship, teaching, and personal experimentation. I primarily work with Solidworks, although I also have proficiency in Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360. Over the years, I have gained expertise in various design principles, with a focus on 3D printing, robotics, and mechanical engineering.<br>
                            I started building my experience in 2017 while working at Triton Automation, and I have continuously improved my skills and knowledge since then.

                            I have acquired most of my programming experience through self-teaching. I developed this website myself using an HTML template from HTML5 UP. My primary programming languages are Python, Java, and C#, although I have also worked with several other languages on various projects. While I have minor experience with Git, I have worked on several personal programming projects to further enhance my skills.
